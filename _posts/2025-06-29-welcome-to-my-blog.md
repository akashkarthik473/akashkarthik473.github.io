# Welcome to My Blog! üöÄ

Hello everyone! I'm excited to finally start this blog where I'll be documenting my journey as a Computer Science student at San Jose State University. This space will be dedicated to sharing my experiences, learnings, and adventures in two of my biggest passions: **coding** and **Formula SAE/Spartan Racing**.

## What to Expect

### üíª Coding Content
I'll be sharing:
- Programming projects I'm working on
- Tutorials and learning resources I find helpful
- Challenges I face and how I solve them
- Tech stack explorations and comparisons
- Career development insights

### üèéÔ∏è Formula SAE / Spartan Racing
As part of the Spartan Racing team at SJSU, I'll be documenting:
- Our car design and development process
- Team dynamics and collaboration
- Competition experiences and lessons learned
- Technical challenges in automotive engineering
- The intersection of software and mechanical engineering

## Why I'm Starting This Blog

1. **Document My Learning**: Writing helps me process and retain information better
2. **Build a Portfolio**: Showcase my projects and experiences
3. **Connect with Others**: Meet fellow students, developers, and racing enthusiasts
4. **Track Progress**: See how far I've come in my journey

## My Current Focus Areas

### Academic
- Advanced Data Structures & Algorithms
- System Design principles
- Software Engineering best practices

### Formula SAE
- Controls system development
- Data analysis for performance optimization
- Team coordination and project management
- Competition preparation

## What's Coming Next

I have several posts planned:
- "My First Year with Spartan Racing"
- "Data Structures Deep Dive: When to Use What"
- "Formula SAE Competition Prep: Behind the Scenes"
