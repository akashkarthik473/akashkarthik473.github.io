# My First Year with Spartan Racing üèéÔ∏è

It has been a year since I joined the **Spartan Racing Formula SAE team** as an intern and I can honestly say it has been one of the most life changing experiences I've ever had.


## The Beginning

When I first heard about Formula SAE during my freshman year, I was immediately intrigued. The idea of designing, building, and racing a formula-style car seemed like the perfect combination of my interests in engineering and my love for technology. Fast forward to now, and I'm finally becoming an official designer for the next car (SR-17).

## What is Formula SAE?

For those who might not be familiar, **Formula SAE** is an international student design competition organized by SAE International. Teams from universities around the world design, build, and race small-scale formula-style racing cars. The competition evaluates teams on:

- **Design**: Engineering analysis and innovation
- **Cost**: Manufacturing cost analysis
- **Presentation**: Business presentation skills
- **Dynamic Events**: Acceleration, skid pad, autocross, and endurance racing

## My Role on the Team

As a Computer Science student, I'm primarily involved in the **controls** aspect of our car. My responsibilities include:

### üñ•Ô∏è Software Development
- **Controls System**: Developing software to control vehicle dynamics such as limitiing the power draw of the car.
- **Data Analysis**: Processing and analyzing performance data

### üìä Data Management
- **Sensor Integration**: Working with various sensors (temperature, pressure, speed, etc.)
- **Performance Analysis**: Using data to optimize car performance

## What I've Learned So Far

### Technical Skills
1. **Embedded Systems**: Working with microcontrollers and sensors
2. **Real-time Data Processing**: Handling high-frequency sensor data
3. **Team Collaboration**: Coordinating with mechanical and electrical engineers
4. **Project Management**: Understanding the complexity of large engineering projects

### Soft Skills
1. **Communication**: Explaining technical concepts to non-technical team members
2. **Problem Solving**: Debugging issues in a multidisciplinary environment
3. **Time Management**: Balancing academic work with team commitments
4. **Leadership**: Taking initiative in my area of expertise

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Learning the Hardware
**Problem**: Coming from a software background, I had limited knowledge of automotive systems and sensors.

**Solution**: 
- Spent time with mechanical team members learning about car components
- Read technical documentation for sensors and microcontrollers
- Started with simple projects such as a PID closed loop system before tackling complex ideas

### Challenge 2: Team Coordination
**Problem**: Coordinating software development with mechanical and electrical teams.

**Solution**:
- Regular team meetings to align on requirements
- Clear documentation of software interfaces
- Early prototyping to identify integration issues

## Current Projects

### 1. Vehicle Simulation
I'm developing a system to simulate our car in a programming environment to better tune the PID:
- Realistic physics
- Accelerometer data
- Real-time graphing

## The Team Dynamic

One of the most rewarding aspects has been working with students from different engineering disciplines:

- **Mechanical Engineers**: Focus on chassis, suspension, and powertrain
- **Electrical Engineers**: Handle wiring, power distribution, and sensors
- **Computer Science Students**: Develop software and data systems
- **Business Students**: Handle cost analysis and business presentation

- Help train new team members

## Advice for New Team Members

If you're considering joining a Formula SAE team:

1. **Start Early**: Don't wait until you're an upperclassman
2. **Be Proactive**: Take initiative in your area of expertise
3. **Learn from Others**: Every team member has valuable knowledge
4. **Document Everything**: Good documentation saves time later
5. **Stay Organized**: Engineering projects can get complex quickly

## Next Steps

I'm excited to continue this journey! In the coming months, I'll be:
- Working on my role for SR-17!
    - Could be optimizing our powerlimiting algorithm
    - Reworking our launch control system
    - Researching torque vectoring methods for the 2026-2027 season
